                <h3>The Dangers of Driving with a Cracked or Chipped Windshield</h3>
                <p>
                    Did you know that anything obstructing a driver’s view is considered a hazard? That means dirty and smudged windows, squashed bugs, bird droppings, chips and cracks. A lot of motorists don’t see the problem with driving around with a cracked or chipped window, especially if it hasn’t affected their vision when on the road. However, chips and cracks will get bigger over time and eventually turn into a major problem. The slightest touch can turn a tiny blemish into a huge crack in the glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually if the chip is small, we can repair and restore the windshield without completely replacing the glass. This is not the case with a crack, full windshield replacements are necessary because the glass is vulnerable and the smallest thing can cause it to burst. You do not want to be on the road when that happens! Be vigilant, never take risks when it comes to road safety and fix that windshield of yours, especially if you are someone who relies heavily on their motorized vehicle. An accident will leave your car or you and others in the hospital, or worse…
