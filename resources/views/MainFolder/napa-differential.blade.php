                    Why is the Differential so Important?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    The differential is crucial in any vehicle for a number of reasons. First, it is the component that is responsible for transferring engine power to your vehicle’s wheels so without it your vehicle would be going nowhere fast.

                    On top of that, the differential is what ensures that your vehicle takes corners and turns smoothly. The differential adjusts your vehicle to the different distances that outside and inside wheels take turns at, so as to guarantee that a Sunday drive in the countryside doesn’t end in disaster! In any turn the inside wheel must turn more slowly than the outside wheel as it has a smaller distance to travel. The differential allows the wheels on a vehicle to turn at different speeds while maintaining full control.

                    Vehicles with four-wheel drive are equipped with a differential in the front and back of the vehicle. While all-wheel drives come with a differential between both the front and rear set of wheels and a transfer case between them.

                    Signs of Differential Damage

                <p >
                    It doesn’t matter if your vehicle is a four-wheel drive or a regular hatchback, over time wear and tear can damage the differential. Noise coming from the differential is a sign that something is wrong and may be caused by insufficient fluid or lubricant or work out gears or bearings. It is important that if you notice a problem with your differential that you have the problem sorted as soon as possible.
