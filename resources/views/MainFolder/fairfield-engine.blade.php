                    Common Engine Problems
                </h2>
                <p >
                    It doesn’t matter how old your car is, how far you have driven it, or who manufactured it, engine repair and maintenance is a reality all car owners will have to face sooner or later. While regular professional maintenance can help reduce the risk of your engine breaking down, it’s never guaranteed.

                <p>
                    In all of our years in the engine repair business, here are some of the most common engine problems we encounter regularly.

                    Engine Won’t Start
                </h2>
                <p >
                    If your engine won’t start, it might mean:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group ps-3 pb-3 differentialtext">
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Low or dead battery</li>
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Corroded or loose battery cables</li>
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignition switch failure</li>
                    <li class="list-item "><img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel pump is defective</li>
                    <li class="list-item "><img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clogged fuel filter</li>
                    <li class="list-item "><img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Starter motor relay failure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If the engine clicks but doesn’t crank, then it’s typically a battery issue. If it cranks but doesn’t start, then it is usually a sign that there is a problem with the fuel or ignition systems.

                    Engine Overheating
                </h2>
                <p >
                    An overheating engine is most likely due to low coolant levels. Frequent overheating can cause serious and pricey damage to engines. If your engine continues to overheat regardless of how much coolant you are putting in to it, it might mean:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group ps-3 pb-3 differentialtext">
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Coolant system is leaking or damaged</li>
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Faulty thermostat</li>
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooling fan is malfunctioning</li>
                    <li class="list-item "><img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken radiator hose</li>
                    <li class="list-item "><img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Defective radiator cap</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A cracked head or blown head gasket may also be causing your engine to overheat. White exhaust smoke is usually an indication that there’s a problem with your engine’s cooling system and may require service immediately.

                    Check Engine Light
                </h2>
                <p >
                    The check engine light is designed to light up whenever a fault is detected in any of the sensors attached to the emission, engine, or powertrain controls. Although useful, it can often be the source of frustration for drivers because it fails to give them any indication of the nature of the problem. They only know that there might be a problem.

                <p>
                    The service engine light could be notifying you about:
