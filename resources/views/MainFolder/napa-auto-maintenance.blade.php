                    By regularly having maintenance and inspection checks with us we can ensure you that your vehicle will operate to its optimal level. Not only that, but regular maintenance checks also save you dollars in the long. Fixing a minor problem early on will ensure that it doesn’t become a major problem at a later date. This will not only save you hundreds if not thousands of dollars but will also ensure that you’re not off the road for long. Replacement parts are pricey and can take time to source if you happen to drive a custom-built or rare vintage model. Don’t risk this headache and invest in regular maintenance checks instead.

                    What Does a Golden State Tire & Auto Shop Maintenance Check Consist of?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Our team of skilled mechanics at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop recommends that you bring your vehicle in for a routine check every 30,000 miles. This series of regular checks will ensure that your vehicle stays at its very best for longer. Our maintenance checks are vehicle specific which means that no two checks will ever be the same. In general, we will examine every part of your car or truck’s interior, paying particular attention to tuning up spark plugs and filters as well as oil changes and transmission maintenance. If your vehicle has driven over 250,000 miles then we will also change belts, rotors and test the battery as standard.
