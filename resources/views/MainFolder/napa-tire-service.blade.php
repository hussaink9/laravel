                    When it comes to ensuring that your car performs at its highest level there are a wide range of factors to consider. One of the most important things to ensure is that your car’s tires are operating to the optimal level possible. This doesn’t just mean that they look good, it means that they must perform to the highest level too. Tires performing to their best need to have the tread depth checked regularly, have any rips or scratches repaired and insure that that they are sufficiently pumped. This might seem like a pretty straightforward check-list. However hundreds of Napa motorists’ have ended up having to buy new tires because they didn’t maintain their old set correctly. Don’t make this mistake.

                    Factors that can Damage Your Tires

                    When it comes to tire damage there are a number of issues to look out for. One of the first things to keep an eye on is tread depth. There are a number of simple tests that will indicate if your tires depth has depreciated but if you’re not sure then bring them into us at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop and we will have one of our skilled repair technicians look it over.

                    The fact of the matter is that tires are designed and built to withstand more abuse than most other parts of your car. They are nothing if not resilient. However, this doesn’t mean that they are indestructible. Placing too much weight or strain on your tires is the beginning of the end for them. This is not only damaging for your tires but is also extremely dangerous for you, your passengers and other road users. After all, your tires are the only part of your car that touch the road so any damage to them could result in you losing control of the vehicle.

                    The best way of ensuring that this isn’t the case is to ensure that you don’t put too much weight on your tires and you don’t drive them too fast. The latter is something only you can control and means that you should always stick to the designated speed limit. However, the weight placed on your tires can be monitored by your tire weight index.

                    The tire weight index of your vehicle’s tires is a sequence of letters and numbers located in the sidewall of your tires and will indicate how much weight they should carry. By investing in a regular tire service check from us we will make sure that this index is not exceeded. This will greatly reduce the risk of tire damage or even a blowout.
