                    Differential Repair in Vacaville
                </h2>

                    In the auto repair industry there is a general consensus that the differential is the one piece of vehicle equipment that is least understood and most under-appreciated. Most Vacaville drivers don’t realize this but the differential is the difference between a smooth, accident-free drive and one where you find yourself off the road and in a ditch.

                    You see, when turning corners the two outside set of tires have a slightly longer distance to travel than the inside ones and as a result they have to turn a little faster than those on the inside. The differential is the piece of magic that allows this to happen without sending your car spiraling out of control.

                    How Your Vehicle’s Differential Works
                </h2>
                <p >
                    The differential is the component in your car that allows your vehicle to rotate at different speeds without the wheel binding. If you are driving a rear-wheel drive then the differential is the bulge in the middle of the axle. However, if you have a front-wheel drive then the differential function is controlled by the transaxle. Nowadays, a lot of Vacaville vehicles are all-wheel drives and, as such, have differentials on both axles as well as a transfer case between both axles to compensate for any speed differentials between the two.

                    The differential in your vehicle is one of the strongest and most durable pieces of equipment. It is tough, can withstand tons of pressure and is built to last. However to ensure that it doesn’t rust or deteriorate it is crucial to keep it lubricated at all times.

                    Differential fluid cools and protects the gears from wear and tear and is a crucial ingredient in the recipe of happy car maintenance. At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop our mechanics will check your differential fluid and make any necessary adjustments. Low differential fluid levels not only affects the effectiveness of your vehicle’s gears but could also cause the differential to become too hot and wear prematurely. Fresh differential fluid will extend its life and the best way of achieving that is by ensuring that your vehicle is regularly checked by mechanics you can trust. Golden State Tire & Auto Shop is that garage. Don’t take chances with inferior providers contact the team you can trust today.
