                    How Often Should I Have my Vehicle Inspected?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    The answer to this question relies on a number of factors such as the age of your vehicle, whether it was bought new or second-hand, if it has been involved in any previous crashes or collisions, how many miles it has on the clock, as well as its general road-worthiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, that being said, there are a number of key guidelines which, if followed, should ensure that your car, motorbike or truck will receive the appropriate level of mechanic maintenance. They are as follows:

                    Should I Repair it or Replace it?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    There was a time when if your windshield, side or rear window had been damaged by a stone, rock or piece of fallen debris it would have to be replaced. Thanks to advancements in auto glass repair equipment that is no longer the case and an increasing number of vehicles in Fairfield are needing their vehicle’s windows replaced. That being said, a number of factors are still important to consider when deciding whether to repair or replace your auto glass, including:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Size:</strong> While it is true that advances in glass repair equipment can mean larger cracks and holes can now be repaired, the fact of the matter is that most cracks more than three inches long will need to be replaced rather than repaired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Location:</strong> The simple truth of the matter is that a crack at the bottom of your view window is not as damaging as one on the driver’s side of the windshield. Cracks in windshields also spread quicker and can compromise the integrity of the glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Line of Vision:</strong> It very much depends on the crack, but it is sometimes better to replace a windshield that has a crack in the driver’s line of vision rather than repair it.
