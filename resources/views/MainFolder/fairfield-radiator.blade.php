                    One of the most common ways of ensuring that you never have to deal with an overheating engine is to ensure that all aspects of your car’s cooling system are properly maintained and, if needed, repaired. One of the most important things to consider is your vehicle’s radiator.

                    This is a commonly asked question among Fairfield motorists and the answer is very simple. In essence, the radiator in your car or truck is responsible for ensuring that the coolant which is needed to keep your engine from over-heating is distributed and processed evenly. The radiator hoses are primarily responsible for this task and need to be strong and sturdy enough to be able to handle heat of an engine that can reach temperatures close to 200 degrees Celsius. By the same token, the radiator cap and tubes ensure that the radiator operates to an optimal level consistently.
