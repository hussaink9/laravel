                    Three Common Transmission Problems
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Transmission problems can present themselves in a wide variety of ways. Here are three of the most common:

        <div class="row">

                <h6 class="mt-3 ">
                    <strong>1.Clutch</strong> 
                </h6>
                <p >
                    If your clutch jams then this can be very problematic. A jammed clutch can result in the amount of solenoid in your clutch becoming locked resulting in the amount of transmission fluid in the torque converter being miscalculated.

                   <strong>2. Solenoid</strong> 
                </h6>
                <p >
                    If your transmission is slipping but you cannot detect any leaks then chances are there is an issue with the solenoid. This can occur because of insufficient fluid levels and other electronic problems. They need to be addressed quickly to ensure the problem doesn’t worsen.

                   <strong>2. Torque Converter</strong> 
                </h6>
                <p >
                    If the needle bearings in your torque converter become damaged then you will most likely hear some very strange noises coming from your transmission when you change gears. It is very important that this problem is addressed immediately.
