                    For many young and aspiring Fairfield drivers the thought of getting behind the wheel and driving their own car on a cross-country adventure is very appealing, and so it should be. However, before doing so it is important to realize that owning your own vehicle is a big step. Sure you know that you’ll have to pay for your own gas and maybe learn how to change a tire, but have you considered some of the smaller details like changing your vehicle’s oil?

                    Oil Change: A Crucial Part of Regular Vehicle Maintenance

                    While the thread depth of your tires, the functionality of your engine and the strength of your windshield will all need to be tested from time to time, ensuring that the oil in your vehicle is changed regularly is crucial. In fact, it is probably one of the most important parts of any maintenance check for your car, bike or van.

                    An oil change consists of removing old oil from your vehicle and replacing it with new, fresh oil. At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we generally change the oil filter at the same time we change the oil in your vehicle. This is necessary to ensure your vehicle receives the optimal benefits from this procedure.

                    Why is it so Important to Have Regular Oil Changes?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    As you may know, the engine in your vehicle is made of many moving parts that work together to ensure the optimal operation of your car or truck. However, after a period of time, this constant motion can lead to friction that can damage your engine. The oil in your engine acts as a necessary lubricant that allows the moving components of your engine to interact seamlessly while also acting as a coolant to absorb the heat that this kinetic motion creates. This places a lot of pressure on your engine and its oil and, over time, it can break down and become less effective. When this happens it is time for an oil change.

                    How Often Should I have my Oil Changed?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Regular oil changes ensure that this goal is achieved before serious damage is caused to your vehicle. At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we always advise our Fairfield customers to have their oil changed every 3,500 miles. Failing to do so could result in serious damage to your vehicle’s engine.
