                    What is the Primary Function of a Car Radiator?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    In essence the radiator is responsible for keeping your engine cool. As you may be aware, things can get pretty heated under the hood. The mechanical motion of hundreds of interlinked components mixing with a bustling engine, oil filters and fan-belts can make it extremely hot. If not cooled, this friction could cause lots of problems. The radiator ensures that the engine stays sufficiently cool to ensure that it completes its primary function correctly. It achieves this by ensuring that coolant is passed through to the engine. The coolant in this case is generally water but could also be antifreeze. The radiator ensures that this liquid is heated up within the engine to run effectively but is then cooled down outside the engine for optimal cooling purposes. In general, the radiator is located at the front of the vehicle’s hood near the grill to maximize available airflow.

                    The Importance of Coolant
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Irrespective of the importance of your vehicle’s radiator, it is necessary to ensure that coolant levels are high enough otherwise your engine will certainly overheat. It is always important to remember to never fill coolant to your vehicle while the engine is hot. To do so could severely damage the engine.

                <strong><u>2.Radiator Sludge: </u></strong>One of the most common radiator-related problems is sludge. The build-up of sludge can darken the coolant. It can also lead to coolant not being able to drain properly and will end up remaining in the radiator far too long.
