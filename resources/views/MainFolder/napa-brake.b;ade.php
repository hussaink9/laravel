                    How Brakes Work
                </h2>
                <p >
                    In order to know how brake defects occur it is first necessary to understand how brakes work. A fully-functioning set of brakes reduces the speed in your car using friction. In that sense they are, in some ways at least, the polar opposite of the engine which always needs to be lubricated and free of friction to operate correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the front brakes, friction is created using the brake pads and calipers. While in the back brakes, friction hits the brake drums. Creating this friction is essential to reduce the speed of your vehicle and ensure a smooth driving performance.

                    WFactors that Can Affect this Friction
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Greasy or oily brakes are one of the number one causes of brake failure. The reason for this is simple: When oil or grease seeps onto your brakes they automatically become more lubricated and lose the friction that is necessary for them to reduce the speed generated from your engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overheating brake pads result in hot spots. Hot spots resist the friction from brake pads, as the pads have nothing to grasp onto there is no friction. As a result, braking power is lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brake pads wearing thin is another feature of a faulty brake pad system. If you hear your brakes squealing then that is not a good sign. This noise is a clear indication that your brake pads need to be inspected and either repaired or replaced. Determining whether we will be able to repair them or have to replace them will very much depend on how long the depreciation has been allowed to occur for. Like almost anything in your vehicle, the sooner you bring the problem to us the more likely it is that we will be able to fix it.
