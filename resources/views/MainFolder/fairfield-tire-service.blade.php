                    Tire Service in Fairfield
                </h2>
                <p >
                    While some Fairfield drivers feel that a tire service is simply having your tires checked for thread depth issues or repairs. Others believe that it is the process of having your tires changed. The fact of the matter is that at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop our tire service is much more developed than that. Since first opening our doors, we have earned a reputation for providing unrivalled tire sales and service. Not only will we repair any damage to your tires but we can also provide you with expert advice on choosing a new set.
                </p>

                    What You Can Expect From Golden State Tire & Auto Shop’s Tire Service
                </h2>
                <p >
                    When you come to Golden State Tire & Auto Shop for a tire test then you should expect the best. That includes three of the following procedures as standard:

                    <u>1.Thread Depth Test</u>
                </h5>
                <p >
                    At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we recommend checking the thread depth in your tires every 5,000 KM. There are a number of ways of measuring if your tires need to be replaced but perhaps the most common is the simple penny test. Place a penny into the grooves on your tires. If you can see the entire head on the front side then it is time to replace those tires.

                    <u>2. Tire Air Pressure Check</u>
                </h5>
                <p >
                    While this may seem a relatively straightforward procedure you would be shocked at the number of Fairfield drivers who have their tires either under or overinflated. Ensuring that your tires’ air pressure is correct will counteract any wear and tear issues as well as improve fuel economy.

                </h5>
                <p >
                    One of the biggest causes of wear and tear on tires is misalignment. If your tires are not properly aligned, this can cause irreparable long-term damage.
