                    A Repair First Philosophy
                </h2>
                <p >
                    At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we are very proud of the award-winning auto-glass repair service that we have provided to Vacaville drivers since first opening our doors. At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we always try and keep things simple so that is why when you come to visit one of our mechanics with a windshield, window or mirror related problem you will receive honest and straightforward advice. We are not in the business of complicating matters just for the sake of it, so when we say something you can be assured that we mean it. When it comes to auto glass repair our only philosophy is that we will try to repair first before all else.

                    While some companies will tell you that you need a replacement windshield, window or mirror before even assessing the damage, we will always look to repair first. The reason for this is two-fold. First of all, we trust the work of our team of skilled repair technicians whole-heartedly. This means that if they say the can repair a problem then we know that they possess the skill, expertise and cutting-edge equipment to get the job done. Secondly, by adopting a repair first philosophy we can save you time and money. The cost of repairing a windshield is far less than replacing it and is also generally a much quicker process. This means that you can get back on the road sooner rather than later. If you have been to a garage and they have ruled a repair out then why not opt for a second opinion?

                    Time is of the Essence

                    One of the biggest misconceptions that Vacaville drivers have is the assumption that once a windshield has been damaged, it will have to be replaced. This is not true. In fact at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we have been repairing windshields and front and rear side windows expertly for years. With our skilled team of repair technicians on the case, you can rest assured that whatever can be done, will be done. This means that if the windshield or car window can be repaired then it will be repaired. However when it comes to any type of auto glass repair, time is very much of the essence. The sooner our professionally certified team of repair technicians can assess the damage, the more likely it is that a repair of your windshield will be possible and the sooner your vehicle will be back in full working order.
