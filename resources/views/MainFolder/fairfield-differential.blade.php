                    Differential Repair in Fairfield
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Unless you are a gearhead, you may not be aware of a little piece of machinery in your vehicle known as the differential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your car turns, the outside wheels have a longer distance to travel than the wheels on the inside. This means, the outside wheels need to spin slightly faster than the ones on the inside of the turn or else the vehicle could pull itself apart. The piece of machinery that makes it possible to divide two separate torques is called the differential.

                <p>
                    The differential is found in most vehicles, especially any vehicles that boast an all-wheel or four-wheel drive feature. And because this gearbox is in charge of converting engine power and its transmission to the wheels, allowing them to turn at varying speeds, it is incredibly important that your vehicle’s differentials get regular maintenance and repairs whenever they start squealing.

                    Signs Your Differential Needs Repairs
                </h2>
                <p >
                    A few telltale signs that your differential needs repairs include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-group ps-3 pb-3 differentialtext">
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whirring noises while decelerating to or driving at speeds that exceed 15 mph</li>
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Rumbling sounds that begin when your vehicle is traveling faster than 15 mph</li>
                    <li class="list-item "> <img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clunking sounds are persistent and pervasive</li>
                    <li class="list-item "><img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;High-pitched howling is heard when accelerating</li>
                    <li class="list-item "><img src="/images/mainpage/bullets.png" alt=""width="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;Banging or skipping occurs when turning a corner</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If one or more of these symptoms accurately describes your vehicle, it is a pretty clear indication that there is something not right.

                    Differential Maintenance
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Because a vehicle cannot function without a working differential, it is important that you get your differential checked and the differential fluid changed every time you take your vehicle in for maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frequency of differential maintenance varies depending on the vehicle, as well as how long it’s been off the lot and how much mileage has been put on its odometer. For more details on the kind of maintenance program your vehicle may need, please contact one of our mechanics today to get their trusted assessment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An alternative to bringing your vehicle for differential maintenance is to regularly check your vehicle’s differential fluid levels. When differential fluid levels are low, the vehicle’s gears can overheat and wear down prematurely. If you need any assistance figuring out how this is done, please contact us today.
