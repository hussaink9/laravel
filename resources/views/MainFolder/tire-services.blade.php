                    Poor tire performance is often linked to insufficient air and incorrect tire rotation. Overinflated tires are just as much of a problem as inadequate inflation and result in excessive and premature tread wear. Several costly vehicle repairs can be traced to poor tire performance that could have been easily avoided with basic maintenance. Proper wheel alignment and correct balancing of your tires not only protects your investment in your vehicle, but ensures smooth and safe driving. Visit the Golden State Tire & Auto Shop auto repair specialists for regular checks to increase the lifespan of your tires and improve overall performance. We invite you to visit our location for inspection, tire rotation and balancing.

                    It’s unfortunate but it is true. When it comes to your tire’s durability and longevity look to the climate. If you live in a place with drastic season changes or exceptionally unpredictable weather, then you can expect to experience more wear and tear than someone who lives in a calmer weather zone. That’s not to say that maintaining functional and durable tires is out of your power. It just means that as a motorist, you need to be slightly more vigilant than a driver who lives in a calmer environment.
