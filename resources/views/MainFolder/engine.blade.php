                    Signs of An Engine Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engine trouble is the absolute worst! Nothing quite causes stress like a malfunctioning engine. We’ve all seen that poor motorist pulled off to the side of the road with smoke fuming out of the front hood of their car and frantically trying to figure out what went wrong? A lot of factors determine just how long a lifespan your vehicles engine will have. Calculate in the year of manufactured, the amount of mileage or usage. Are you giving the car regular oil changes and keeping up with maintenance? What make or brand is it and are there any known engine difficulties? In order to prevent yourself from becoming that person on the side of the road, we’ve created a small index that will help you to identify signs that your engine is in need of a tune-up or replacement. Read below, and remember you can google almost anything but there is no information like the kind you get from hands on professionals like Golden State Tire & Auto Shop. Our specialists are here to answer specific questions and discuss the concerns of our clients. Here are some signs of an engine problem:

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6 enginetext2">
                <h4>
                    Lower gas mileage
                </h4>
                <p>
                If you’re at the gas pump more often, but haven’t changed your driving habits, there could be an issue with the compression of your engine. Potential solutions include using a fuel cleaner or getting a tune up. An engine diagnostic from our repair specialist will clarify the issue and provide options.

            <div class="col-6 enginetext3">
                <h4>
                    Knocking and banging
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Popping and other loud noises from your vehicle when you start the engine is often an indication of a problem with the internal combustion flow and a clear sign to schedule a service appointment.

        <div class="row pb-5">

                    Engine stalling
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Several issues can cause an engine to stall including problems with the air/fuel mixture, or issues with the intake stroke. Investigate ongoing stalls promptly, to avoid more expensive damage down the road.
                </p>

                    Engine odor
                </h4>
                <p>
                    An engine exhaust will emit strong smelling, toxic fumes just prior to failing and indicates the need for an engine diagnostic ASAP.
