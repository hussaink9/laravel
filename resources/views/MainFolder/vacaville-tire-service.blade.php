                    Knowing About Tread Depth
                </h2>
                <p >
                    In essence your tires’ tread depth is what measures if they are road-worthy or not. However, there are a lot of factors to take into consideration when measuring them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing to note is that there are different guidelines, as well as legal requirements in most states and provinces, regarding what treat depth your tires should be depending if they are a summer or winter set. At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we recommend that your tires should be replaced when they reach 4/32 in the winter and 2/32 in the summer. This isn’t just a personal opinion, most manufacturers would agree that if your tires wear to this level and beyond they are bald and would no longer be considered road-worthy.

                    Checking Your Tire Tread Depth the Old Fashioned Way
                </h2>
                <p >
                    At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we use a gauge to measure the tread depth of your tires, this is quick and effective way of assessing if the need to be changed. However, we are acutely aware of the fact that not every Vacaville driver will have that luxury. If you about to embark on a long trip and want to ensure that your tires have a sufficient tread depth, and don’t have time to visit our garage, then you can do so using the most traditional means possible with the quarter test.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply insert the quarter into the tires groove with the caribou nose facing down. If the tire tread covers the tip of the nose then you are good to go but if it doesn’t then you need to consider making a change right away.
