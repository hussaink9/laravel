                    When it comes to ensuring that your car stays on the road for as long as possible there is one word that is more important than all the rest. That word is regular. Regular maintenance and inspection of your vehicle will ensure that it will be of roadworthy condition for as many years as possible. What’s more, regular check-ups will also ensure that the safety of you and your family is enhanced and that peace of mind is priceless.

                    If you bring your vehicle into us for an annual inspection then we will guarantee that it will receive the most thoroughly advanced emissions test available. As a driver you will be aware of the fact that all vehicles are now obliged to pass an emissions test to be allowed on the road. This is an important law that is in place to safeguard the environment from harmful toxins and fumes. If you have experienced problems passing this test in the past then it is crucial that you bring your vehicle to Golden State Tire & Auto Shop right away. Our team of licensed professionals knows every part of this environmental regulation and will be able to make the necessary changes to your vehicle to ensure that it passes the test.
