                    Whether it’s changing weather conditions, unforeseen debris from a windy day in Fairfield or a misguided baseball pitch, the auto glass on your vehicle is susceptible to damage from a wide range of sources. Damage to the windshield, back or side windows of your car or truck can be extremely frustrating and, if not repaired correctly, could prove very dangerous.

                    In most average-sized vehicles a windshield will makes up 30% of its strength. The slightest chip, crack or fracture to it could greatly compromise your family’s safety should a collision occur. Similarly, not having the adequate repair work done to a damaged side or rear window could run the risk of reducing visibility.

                    Should I Repair it or Replace it?
                </h2>

                    There was a time when if your windshield, side or rear window had been damaged by a stone, rock or piece of fallen debris it would have to be replaced. Thanks to advancements in auto glass repair equipment that is no longer the case and an increasing number of vehicles in Fairfield are needing their vehicle’s windows replaced. That being said, a number of factors are still important to consider when deciding whether to repair or replace your auto glass, including:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Size:</strong> While it is true that advances in glass repair equipment can mean larger cracks and holes can now be repaired, the fact of the matter is that most cracks more than three inches long will need to be replaced rather than repaired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Location:</strong> The simple truth of the matter is that a crack at the bottom of your view window is not as damaging as one on the driver’s side of the windshield. Cracks in windshields also spread quicker and can compromise the integrity of the glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Line of Vision:</strong> It very much depends on the crack, but it is sometimes better to replace a windshield that has a crack in the driver’s line of vision rather than repair it.
