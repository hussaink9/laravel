                    Regular Tire Rotation
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Along with regular oil changes, tire rotation is a vital aspect of vehicle maintenance and safety. When you drive regularly, your tires experience wear. Usually your front tires will experience more wear than the back ones because these tires are the ones that you use for acceleration and turning. During a tire rotation service, our experienced mechanics at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop will make sure that the wear on your tires is more evenly spread out. This will mean that you will get more miles out of your existing tires and it will also help to improve the performance of your vehicle and ensure a smooth drive.

                    Oil Changes
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Here at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we are aware of the importance of having peace of mind about vehicle safety. We encourage car owners to have a tire rotation done every 3,000 to 5,000 miles at our downtown garage. Frequent tire rotation means that your vehicle will operate effectively and will also help to ensure the safety of passengers. What’s more, if you have an oil change service at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop at the same time as a tire rotation, you can feel safe in the knowledge that your vehicle is performing to the highest level and that you are extending the life of your vehicle.

                    Tire Wear
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Tires wear differently depending on their axle positioning. In a standard, front-wheel drive car with four tires, the front two tires are likely to have more wear than the back two. This is because the front tires are responsible for most of the braking, as well as the acceleration and braking functions. This means that in a standard tire rotation the front two tires will often be swapped with the back two tires in order to ensure an even spread of tire wear. A tire rotation service ensures enhanced safety for the driver and a high driving performance and it will also save you, as the car owner, money in the long-run. Regular tire rotations at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop will keep Vacaville safe and mean that you continue to get from point A to point B quickly and safely.
