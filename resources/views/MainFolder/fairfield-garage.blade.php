                    Golden State Tire & Auto Shop is the leading mechanic in Fairfield. We take what we very do seriously and that is why when you leave your vehicle in with us, you can rest assured knowing that we will not only fix the problem, but will also explain why it happened in the first place, as well as provide you with information to ensure that it doesn’t happen again. We want to ensure that you won’t have to come back to see us every second week. That being said, if your car, truck or motorcycle is past the point of no repair then we will tell you that too. We have built a reputation on being as honest and upfront as possible, and we fully intend to continue that tradition for years to come. So whether your engine is spluttering, your brake pads have worn thin or you simply need an oil change, contact us right away.

                    What do you look for in your mechanic? Do you want one that cuts corners, tells you what you want to hear and promises you that this will be the last time your transmission will need to be changed? Or do you look for a garage that has earned a reputation for being as diligent and professional as possible, and that will always give the most accurate and honest diagnosis, while ensuring your vehicle is at the highest standard for the longest time possible? If you fall into the second category then there is one number to call.

                    We know that in an ideal world every Fairfield driver would have their tires changed, their radiator replaced or exhaust repaired at the first sign of a problem. We also know that you don’t live in an ideal world and that in the real world of Fairfield money is often tight.

                    It is for that reason that we always aim to keep our prices as low and competitive as possible. We want to ensure that our award-winning mechanic service reaches the highest number of motorists in our city. To achieve that goal we promise to charge a fair and reasonable price. We always itemize our invoices so you know exactly what you are paying for and we also encourage all our customers to question any cost that they are uncertain of. On top of that, we offer a range of flexible payment methods as well as installment options that allow you to spread the cost of the repair over a number of weeks or months rather than having to pay one lump sum up-front.
