                </h2>

                    While most Fairfield drivers know how to change a tire or at least know who to call if they don’t, up to recently many were not familiar with the simple process of tire rotation. Thankfully, due to our pioneering of this service for Fairfield motorists, we are pleased to announce that this lack of information is a thing of the past.

                    What are the Benefits of Regular Tire Rotation?
                </h2>

                    Tire rotation is one of the most important features of the preventative maintenance service that Golden State Tire & Auto Shop provides. Regular tire rotation will not only make your tires more safe on the road, but it will also drastically reduce side to side and front to rear thread depth issues. However, the benefits of investing in this preventative maintenance procedure are more long lasting than merely reducing thread depth.

                    Tire Rotations and Oil Changes
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Regular tire rotation also guarantees better handling for your vehicle and if changed within the 3,000 – 5,000 mile mark then it will also ensure that your tires meet the standard guidelines of the industry manufacturers. What’s more, by sticking to these distance parameters you can ensure that your tires are rotated and that the oil and oil filter is changed at the same regular intervals. This not only makes it more convenient for you as a motorist but also enhances the overall driving quality of your car as the tire and oil changes can benefit from simultaneous mutual upgrading.

                    Tire Rotations: Front Axle and Back Axle
                </h2>
                <p >
                    While it is common for vehicles to be equipped with four tires, the fact of the matter is that the two tires on the front axle serve very different functions than those on the back. This means that that they have the potential to have contrasting thread depth wear patterns and, as such, need to be monitored very closely for enhanced driving and safety. Another reason why Golden State Tire & Auto Shop believes that regular tire rotations can prove very beneficial for Fairfield drivers is because it allows us to measure and monitor the thread depth depreciation in your vehicle.

                    The fact of the matter is that there is a distinct advantage to your tires’ thread depth wearing away together. Not only does a more balanced depreciation allow all four tires to respond to a driver’s input more quickly, but it also helps maintain handling and increase the tire’s cornering traction. When the four tires wear out together, it is also good for your pocket. Buying a set of four tires together is considerably more advantageous than having to buy two sets of two and changing them intermittently.
