                    The radiator in your vehicle keeps the engine cool and safeguards it against overheating. In addition, components in the cooling system of your vehicle eventually build up deposits that require a radiator flush to keep your engine running smoothly. In simpler terms, without a functional car radiator your engine would overheat and create some serious damage to all the inner mechanics in your vehicle, it would also be deemed a safety hazard because of potential leaks.

                <h3>Dangers of Radiator Leaks</h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone seems to assume that engine and brake complications are the most dangerous and cause the majority of accidents. This isn’t necessarily true. An automobile radiator leak is extremely hazardous and toxic. The moment you notice a red or green fluid seeping from your car, it is unsafe to drive. A coolant puddle is highly toxic for both the people and the environment. So make sure your pets or kids are not anywhere need the vicinity. The best thing to do would be to call in a mechanic to take a look at the vehicle and see if a full replacement is necessary of if repairs can solve the problem.
