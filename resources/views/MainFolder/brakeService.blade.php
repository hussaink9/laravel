                <p>
                    When it comes to the brakes on your car, you can never be too diligent.

The number one sign that your brakes need a tune up or replacement is the screeching sound they make every time your car comes to an abrupt halt. Usually it’s hard to miss and you can even hear it through rolled up windows but if you are listening to music or the radio, you’ll likely to miss it. Here are a few other signs to watch out for:
