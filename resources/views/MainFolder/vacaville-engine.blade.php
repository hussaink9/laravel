                    At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we are passionate about cars, so much so that our families often think we care more about them than we do about our own flesh and blood.

For us, maintaining and repairing vehicles for our loyal and trusted Vacaville customers is what makes us get up on those tough and cold winter mornings. We strive to do the best job possible each and every day and always seek to improve on what we did yesterday.

                    The Heart of your Car

                    Much like a father or mother comparing their children, we are not in the business of ranking our favorite parts of a car. That being said we think it is fair to say that the first-born always holds a special place in a parent’s heart and for us the engine is the heart of your car. That is not to say that the other components of your vehicle are not important, of course they are. However, the engine is the most important part and needs to be treated as such. Engine repair should be meticulous and detailed with no corners cut. At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop you can rest assured that you will receive the best engine repair service possible.

                    Engine Repair: Diesel or Gas?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    When it comes to engine repair, we often receive a lot of questions from Vacaville customers regarding the pros and cons of a diesel or gas engine. The fact of the matter is that there are perks to both. For instance diesel engines are typically more durable and as a result provide greater fuel efficiency than gas engines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By contrast gas engines are generally easier to drive as they require less knowhow then the sometimes stubborn diesel engine. However, what is the best when it comes to engine repair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While our team of mechanics is comfortable repairing any type of engine, we believe that diesel engines are generally cheaper and easier to repair than their gas counterparts. What’s more, the durable and long-lasting nature of diesel engines means that these repairs are less common meaning further bang for your buck.
