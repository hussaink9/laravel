                    What is an Oil Change?

                    Oil changes are crucial in order to keep your vehicle’s engine running smoothly. The function of oil is to keep your engine lubricated. This reduces friction on the moving parts and helps to ensure that your engine functions at the best possible level. Over time, the oil becomes dirty which means that your engine is not lubricated as well.

                    When our mechanics at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop do an oil change, they remove old oil from your vehicle and replace it with fresh oil. This ensures that the engine is properly lubricated. They also usually change the oil filter during this service. With a new oil filter and fresh oil, your car will now perform to an optimum level.

                    Why Does my Vehicle Need Regular Oil Changes?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Motor oil is important to your vehicle as it helps to make sure that all of the moving parts in the engine work as they should. Oil not only prevents friction but also helps to cool down your engine and fights corrosion. Over time, the engine oil can break down which means that it can no longer function as well. When oil becomes dirty, it does not move around the engine so well, which means that your vehicle engine parts will not move as well. It also means that your engine is more liable to rust and there will be more engine noise. Regular oil changes at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop will prevent this happening and ensure that your vehicle continues to function effectively.
