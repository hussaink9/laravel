                    No matter your level of driving experience, it is probably fair to say that every Fairfield driver is aware of the importance of a functioning set of brakes. Without your brakes working to their optimal level, your vehicle shouldn’t be on the road. One of the most common concerns that our mechanics at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop hear from Fairfield drivers is that they did not know their brakes were in such bad shape. The reason for this is simple; your brakes are one of the strongest parts of your vehicle. Because of this they will continue to operate even when they are worn down. However, if not diagnosed in time then a small problem could turn into something far more dangerous. Don’t take that risk. Make sure you, your family members and others on the road in Fairfield are protected. Have your brakes checked regularly by the premier mechanic service.

While there are many unique parts that go into making the optimal braking system, here are two that you need to pay special attention to:.

                    <u>1.Brake Calipers</u>
                </h2>
                <p >
                The brake calipers in your vehicle are a key part of the functioning disc brake system. The importance of the caliper is tied to the fact that once you press on the brake pedal, the brake fluid flows from the mechanical cylinder to the brake calipers. From there, the brake fluid applies pressure on the piston inside the calipers. This leads to a friction between the brake pads and the rotors which ultimately results in the vehicle reducing in speed and stopping.

                <p>
                Any damage to the brake calipers can affect this entire process, leaving your entire braking system compromised. If you notice any problem when pressing the brake pedal then you need to contact Golden State Tire & Auto Shop right away.

                    <u>2. Brake Rotors</u>
                </h2>
                <p >
                It is always surprising to us when Fairfield drivers are surprised at the importance of brake rotors. These rotors or discs are a crucial part of your vehicle’s overall braking system and need to be properly maintained. The rotors in your vehicle are responsible for stopping your wheel from spinning. In reality, brake rotors and pads are extremely interlinked and a fault to one will affect the other greatly.
