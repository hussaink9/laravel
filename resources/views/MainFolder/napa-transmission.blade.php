                    Three Transmission Problems
                </h2>
                <p >
                    Your vehicle’s transmission is one of the most important parts of your car. It is basically the device that converts the energy generated from your vehicle’s engine and is accurately directed towards the drive-shaft. Without it, one thing is for certain: you’re going nowhere fast. Three of the most common transmission related problems include:

                <strong><u>1. Torque Converter Issues: </u></strong>A damaged torque converter can wreak havoc on your transmission. One of the most common torque problems is deprecation or damage to the needle bearings. If the needle becomes warm then it will, most likely, result in strange noises emanating from the transmission.

               <strong><u>2. Solenoid Problems:  </u></strong>If your transmission is slipping and there are no visible leaks then it is likely that there is a solenoid problem. This needs to be addressed immediately to ensure the proper flow of fluid levels through the transmission.

                <strong><u>2.Clutch Difficulties: </u></strong>Clutch problems are common and can cause great damage to your transmission. If the clutch jams then the amount of transmission fluid in the torque converter may be miscalculated causing the transmission to operate poorly.
