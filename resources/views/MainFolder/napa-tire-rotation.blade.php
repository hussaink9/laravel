                    Like the best things in life, tire rotation for your car seems like a no-brainer. In fact, the simplicity of this service has left many of our Napa motorists asking the question as to why they didn’t think of it sooner. The fact of the matter is that, despite its relative simplicity, tire rotation remains one of the more recent additions to our list of services at Golden State Tire & Auto Shop. However, we are happy to say that it has quickly become a firm favorite with Napa drivers who have realized how beneficial the service really is.

                    What is Tire Rotation?
                </h2>
                <p >
                    The fact of the matter is that when driving tires wear and depreciate at different rates and in different ways depending on the model of our car, where you drive and your driving style. A regular tire rotation service corrects this problem and spreads the tons of weight that your tires experience evenly across all four.

                    At Golden State Tire & Auto Shop we recommend investing in a tire rotation at least once every nine to twelve months. This length of time can vary depending on the age of our car but, in general, this is a good rule of thumb to go by. Regular tire rotation ensures better tread depth and traction on the road. This allows your tires to hug the road better, especially on wet road conditions. This is not only a safety asset for you and your fellow passengers but will also help keep you driving for longer. Our highly skilled tire repair technicians will follow your vehicle’s manufacturing guidelines closely to ensure an optimal level of tire protection. This attention to detail along with our years of experience means that you will be in safe hands with us.

                    Every week we see Napa drivers buying a new set of tires because they did not take care of their old set correctly. This is a big mistake. A new set of tires can set you back thousands of dollars, much more than it costs to have your old tires rotated regularly. Don’t throw your money away needlessly. Invest in an award-winning service today.
