                </h5>
                <p >
                    Regular oil changes keep the internal parts moving parts of your engine clean and lubricated. This also means that they can operate efficiently for longer, resulting in a quieter, smoother ride for you and your fellow passengers.

                    <u>2. Debris-Free Engine: </u>
                </h5>
                <p >
                    The fact of the matter is that old oil will have a certain amount of dust, dirt and debris in it. This is simply one of the hazards of operating close to an engine. While this may not seem like a big deal, if untreated it can cause serious damage to your vehicle’s engine. The best way to avoid this is to ensure that your oil and filters are changed regularly.

                <p >
                    An often overlooked benefit to regular oil changes is that they reduce the friction that can slow your engine down and in turn improve your fuel efficiency. Who is going to say no to more miles to the gallon?
