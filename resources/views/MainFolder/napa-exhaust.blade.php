                    Exhaust Repair in Napa
                </h2>
                <p >
                    One of the most common misconceptions that exists among Napa drivers is that the exhaust in your car consists of the pipe and little else. While the pipe is one of the most important parts of the exhaust, it is far from being the only one. In truth the exhaust in most vehicles consists of a range of connected chambers from the engine to the exhaust pipe that are designed to remove fumes and gases that would prove harmful to your vehicle’s performance. The problem with not being fully aware of the full extent of our exhaust’s powers is that it can become harder to detect a problem before it is too late. That is where we come in.

                    Corrosion: Your Exhaust’s Worst Enemy
                </h2>
                <p >
                    When it comes to exhausts there are very few words that send shivers down the spines of even the most hardened mechanics more than corrosion. Corrosion, or rust as it is more commonly known, can cause irreparable damage to your exhaust if left undetected and untreated. As most people are aware, rust is formed when moisture mixes with the iron in your exhaust to form iron oxide. The moisture in this instance can come from the inside through the presence of vapor that is a by-product of combustion in the catalytic converter. It can also form on the outside because of rain and condensation from wet Napa days! Irrespective of how the moisture gets there one thing is for certain—if it is left untreated then it will wreak havoc on your exhaust.

                    Wintertime Blues

                    Anyone who has experienced a winter in Napa will be able to attest to the fact that without salt on the roads, accidents would happen every day. Unfortunately, while salt helps your vehicle maintain its grip on the road it can prove far more dangerous for the corrosion of your exhaust. To avoid this it is very important that you wash under your car at least once every ten days.
